oco order management way down road

backtsting live updatingchart with strategy. --> cache data for 1 year of snp and just manipulate as strategies are selected to show entries
fix live updates button
fix data normalization button

instead of not being able to select the candles we dont have data for, automatically switch to the highest timeframe that supports those candles (we know its always going to be the 3month----> we need to cache data)

watermark everychart, make everychart downloadable, make more charts. 

option pricing --> volatility surface/skew/crush dashboard integration

add 6 month rsi as a lookback period on the dashboard --> add lookback by different bars: 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour, 4 hour, 1 day maybe a week. 

add market breadth dashboard

enter/exit on cross/RECROSS

in main config--> set bars (default daily). intraday 3 months back max. every indicator will be by bar not nessessarily day

entry conditions:
Strategy Types:
  timing--> enter position on time entered by user, only look for entry conditions between time1 time2 (anything intraday max 3 months back max).
  price above/below $ amount
  price action to MA--> touch/cross/recross --> # touches/crosses (default 1), % above/below on no touch, after cross, after recross ---> delay entry in Bars (0 default)
  RSI to MA --> same deal
  Long and Short MAs --> same deal 
  MAs: BB top, BB middle(just sma), BB Bottom, Keltner Channels same way, EMA, SMA, HMA, KAMA
  allow multiple entry conditions --> allow user to select to enter when all are met or when the first is met. 


exit conditions:
  Mirror entrance
  set take profit --> $ profit, % profit, or strategy type condition met (ex. RSI == BB of RSI middle) 
  set stop loss -->  same deal
  allow multiple exit conditions i guess allow first or all.
